I built my personal portfolio website using Next.js for the framework, Tailwind CSS for styling, and TypeScript for type safety. Next.js provided server-side rendering for SEO and performance, pre-rendering pages for faster load times. Tailwind CSS allowed for a streamlined and iterative styling process using simple utility classes. TypeScript gave me type safety, catching errors during development. \n For the contact form, I integrated the SendGrid API to receive form submissions and send email notifications. Formspree webhooks triggered SendGrid to send the submitted data to my email inbox. \n Building the portfolio site allowed me to experiment with new technologies to create a fast, responsive, and professional website. The minimalistic design optimized for search engines and the user experience. \n By combining Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and SendGrid, I built an effective platform to showcase my skills and experience as a front-end developer. The stacked technologies enabled server-side rendering, modern styling, type safety, and an email contact form - resulting in a high-performing and functional portfolio site.
